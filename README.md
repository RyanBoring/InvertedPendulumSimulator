# Inverted Pendulum Simulator

Using JavaFX via Gradle plugin. Followed tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m) to learn about control theory and implement this simulation. My model uses a stick instead of a point mass on the end of a massless rod, so the pendulum's center of gravity is at half of its length rather than its full length.
